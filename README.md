visualCaptcha-java-rest
========================

Fork of bdotzour's visualCaptcha-java project (Plain Java Servlet backend for visualCaptcha)
using Spring RestController as opposed to Servlets. Runs with Spring Boot so all you need to
do is run `mvn spring-boot:run` and point your browser to http://localhost:8080!
