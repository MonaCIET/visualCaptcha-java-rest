{"name":"visualCaptcha Full-stack Demo for Java / Spring / Rest & AngularJS","tagline":"Java / Spring REST backend for visualCaptcha","body":"visualCaptcha-java-rest [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tillkuhn/visualCaptcha-java-rest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tillkuhn/visualCaptcha-java-rest)\r\n========================\r\nThis is a demo/sample standalone app that uses Spring Boot and the visualCaptcha AngularJS bower package as a proof-of-concept for how to integrate with REST Services based on Spring / Java.\r\n\r\nIt's forked out of bdotzour's [visualCaptcha-java](https://github.com/bdotzour/visualCaptcha-java) project (Plain Java Servlet backend for visualCaptcha) using Spring RestController as opposed to Servlets.\r\n\r\nRuns as a standalone application with Spring Boot so all you need to do is run `mvn spring-boot:run` and point your browser to http://localhost:8080. Most recent version also adds docker support.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/tillkuhn/visualCaptcha-java-rest.git\r\nmvn verify\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run tests\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn test\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run application using maven\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn spring-boot:run\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run application using docker\r\n\r\nNote: Docker support is still experimental\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker build -t visual_captcha_java_rest .\r\ndocker run -d -p 8080:8080 visual_captcha_java_rest\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Todos\r\n\r\n* Complete Implementation for Audio\r\n* Dockerize\r\n* Spring Integration tests\r\n\r\n## Attention\r\n\r\nWork is still in progress and not yet finished, but feel free to contribute!\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\nCopied from [https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-PHP/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-PHP/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\nvisualCaptcha, since 5.0, uses an API for increased security and to become back-end-agnostic (that's why you can easily plug-in a Vanilla JS, AngularJS, or jQuery front-end without changing anything).\r\n\r\nIt expects the following routes to exist, which we've put in this sample, using Slim (just to make it easier).\r\n\r\nYou are expected to have these routes in your implementation, but you can change them in visualCaptcha's front-end config.\r\n\r\n### GET `/start/:howmany`\r\n\r\nThis route will be the first route called by the front-end, which will generate and store session data.\r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n\r\n- `howmany` is required, the number of images to generate.\r\n\r\n### GET `/image/:index`\r\n\r\nThis route will be called for each image, to get it and show it, by index.\r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n\r\n- `index` is required, the index of the image you want to get.\r\n\r\n### GET `/audio(/:type)`\r\n\r\nThis route will be called for the audio file, to get it and play it, either the mp3 or ogg file.\r\n\r\nParameters:\r\n\r\n- `type` is optional, the audio file format defaults to `mp3`, but can also be `ogg`.\r\n\r\n### POST `/try` \r\n\r\nThis is just a sample route, where we post the form to, and where the visualCaptcha validation takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCheck the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n* [visualCaptcha Homepage](http://visualcaptcha.net/)\r\n* [visualCaptcha Ruby + AngularJS](https://github.com/emotionLoop/visualCaptcha-ruby)\r\n* [visualCaptcha Java](https://github.com/bdotzour/visualCaptcha-java)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
